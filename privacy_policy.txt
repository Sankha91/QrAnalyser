This app helps in creating and analysing QR codes on the go.
All the saved datas are stored locally (on the user's device) irrespective of any server.
But don't need to get tensed if your datas are mistakenly deleted from your app, because it will still
remain on the 'QrAnalyser' folder on your sd card.
No data is shared automatically to any third party application without the user's consent.
